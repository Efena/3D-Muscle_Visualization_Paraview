# 3D Visualization of Dynamic Muscle MRI with ParaView
ParaView is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application with which users can quickly build visualizations to analyze their data using qualitative and quantitative techniques.
The aim of this work was to implement a 3D visualization of Dynamic MRI muscle dataset on ParaView. This entails the contraction during Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation of the calf muscles in order to observe the strain patterns.
Taking advantage of the python scripts that can be generated by ParaView, it was possible to create a macro pipeline to facilitate the easy visualization of the acquired Dynamnic MRI dataset.
